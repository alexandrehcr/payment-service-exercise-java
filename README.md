# Payment Service Exercise

### Objective
In this exercise from [Nelio Alves' Java Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-curso-completo) on Udemy, I did more than what was required by incorporating key concepts and sharpening my problem-solving skills with a focus on object-oriented programming, encapsulation, composition, date handling, interface usage, polymorphism, and exception handling.

### Problem
A company wants to automate its contracts processing, generating installments based on desired months. It uses PayPal with a 1% simple interest per installment and a 2% payment fee. The program should read the contract data (number, date, and total value) and the number of months for installment. The program should generate the payment installments with the first one due a month after the contract date and display the installment data.
